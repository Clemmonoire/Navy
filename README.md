# Navy
Epitech Project, navy

The goal of this project was to recreate the famous naval battle game. To achieve this, we had to make two programs communicate with each other using only SIGUSR1 or SIGUSR2 signals. On each turn, we had to display the current position and select the next attack. Once the game was over, we had to show which player had won.

Usage:

first player :
  ./navy boat_poistion
 
second player:
  ./navy first player's PID boat_position
 
Exemple :
